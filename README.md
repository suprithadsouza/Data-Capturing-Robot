A common daily task of a Data Capturer's life is copy-pasting data from an excel spreadsheet into a web or desktop application. This robot fully-automates that task.
The robot copy-pastes 100 lines of customer data into their respective input fields of a web application and desktop application.
The robot even performs both the web and desktop app data capturing simultaneously. This gets the job done in a fraction of the time that a human could with 100% accuracy.
